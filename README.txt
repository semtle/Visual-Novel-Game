            Visual Novel Game
=============================================

This is a Visual Novel Game project made by me and two of my friends as a part of a class at our school at Helsinki Business College.
It is just called Visual Novel Game so far because we have not come up with a better name
  
I am the only person programming this game, the other team members do art and story.

This project was originally done with Python using PyGame.
I decided to redo the entire game in C++ since it is much more powerful and better for game development, and it is the language I will be using in the future to develop games.

The game engine used in this game was created with the help of a YouTube tutorial series made by Benjamin Arnold, and it is hence called "Bengine". You can find more info about him in the ReadMe inside the "Bengine" -folder.
